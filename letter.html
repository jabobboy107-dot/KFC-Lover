    <h1>Letter To Colonel Sanders</h1>
    <p>Dear Sanders, I love you. You are my joy, my delight. You fill my heart
    with peace.<br>The thought of you makes me melt. Your exquisite chicken,
    your delicious selection of spices, it all makes me cry.<br>Colonel Sanders,
    You fill me with happiness. I miss you more than ever right now.<br>I long for just
    one bite of your delicious, juicy, finger-lickin good chicken. I love you Sanders.
